   <h2> <em> "The 7 ”</em></h2>
    
    <h3> Overview of the Major/Basic Chakras </h3>
    
    The study of the major chakra system has an ancient history and has been practiced in Eastern spiritual traditions for generations. These ancient beliefs state that seven primary chakras, which translates to “disks” or “wheels”, are the bio-energetic foundation of human life.
    
    The basic human chakra system is located along the spine, and begins at the base and ends on the top of the head. Each chakra is represented by a color, sound, and relates to different aspects of the human body, belief and thought processes.  
    They even affect the mental, emotional, physical, energetic and spiritual states of the human condition.  
    
    The chakra allow energy to flow through the body from the base to the crown (top) of the head as well as in the opposite direction. With adequate and healthy energy exchange occurs, health is experienced. When the opposite is true, disease occurs.
